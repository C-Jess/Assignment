## Introduction
This project was created for my first year programming II assignment.
I was tasked to create plugin modules for a provided code base as set out by the specification. The plugin modules expand the functionality of the original program by adding different card types which are stored and retrived.
All the plugin modules I wrote are in InfoCards2, the rest of the code was provided.

## Technologies
The code is written in C# using classes, interfaces and forms.

## Setup
To run this project:
* Download code base
* Open solution file in visual studio
* Build all parts
* Run

## Specification
The specification for the project can be found [here](../master/Programming%20II%20Assignment%20Specification.pdf).
